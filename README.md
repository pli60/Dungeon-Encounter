Description:
This is a text generator about players entered a dungeon and obtain different kinds of items from a chest.

Artist Statement:
An addtion to the level of complexity I made was the compound adjectives which generates a more detailed description of an object. I also added a more complex name generator which allows up to hundreds of different names. I tried to include more variant of items that player can obtain with different possible descriptions attached to them. The compound adjectives did the job just fine.
